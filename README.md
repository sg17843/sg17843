ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sg17843

I am a constantly learning beginner in Germany.

Recently, as a user of various applications, I have had contact with Github again and again and would now like to actively participate. 
Initially, certainly with more questions than answers and ideas instead of solutions ... 

Unfortunately, English is not my native language, so I will again have problems with the formulation of questions / answers. 
Thank God there are excellent online translation tools :-)
